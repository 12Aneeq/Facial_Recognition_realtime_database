# Overview
This project demonstrates a face recognition system integrated with a real-time database. The system utilizes a machine learning model to detect and recognize faces in images captured from a webcam. The recognized faces and their associated data are then stored and managed in a real-time database, enabling immediate updates and queries.

# Features
Real-Time Face Recognition: Detect and recognize faces from live video feed or uploaded images.
Database Integration: Store recognized face data in a real-time database for immediate access and updates.
Web Interface: Upload images and view recognized faces through a user-friendly web interface.
Real-Time Updates: Receive instant updates on recognized faces through the real-time database.
